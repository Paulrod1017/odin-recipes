    <h3>Good and Bad At The Same Time</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is one of those types of food that you either love or hate. Now, although I do
        not like lasagna, my wife does so below will be a recipe to make my wife's favorite lasagna!
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cheese Filling</strong>: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. </li>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Sauce:</strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). </li>
        <li><strong>Spinach (variation)</strong>: To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Boil pasta</strong>: Cook in a large pot of salted water <strong><em>per the recipe below.</em></strong></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare meat sauce</strong>: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine cheese mixture</strong>: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer & bake</strong>: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
